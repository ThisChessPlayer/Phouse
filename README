Phouse, also known as the phone mouse, is an android application which can
connect to a computer running a phouse server over wifi and act as a mouse.
This allows for remote control of the computer through a socket connection.
Unlike other android mouse applications, this one moves the mouse through
2-axis accelerometer input, with adjustable sensitivity and left/right click
functionality. Furthermore, the point around which the device detects rotation
can be set using the calibrate button. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Setup

First, place both the computer and Android device on the same network.

On Computer/Server:
  cd phouseServer
  javac driver.java
  java driver

Note the socket requested of the user for future reference.
  
On Android device:
  Download APK.
  For server IP, enter the IP address of the computer.
  For socket, enter the socket noted above.
  Press Connect
  
The mouse will immediately begin moving.
Tilt the device forwards/backwards and side to side to move the cursor around. 
Adjust the sensitivity to a speed of your liking.
The left/right mouse buttons can be held down like a normal mouse's buttons.
Calibrate zeros the speed of the cursor at any given rotation of the device.
